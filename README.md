- 👋 Hi, I'm Erik
- 👀 I am interested in desktop programs, automation, bots and more.
- 🌱 Now I am studying the C # programming language and can already consider myself a junior developer. I do not have any work experience in the company yet, and I am not looking for a job yet. Now study is more important for me, but having mastered certain skills and knowledge, I plan to find myself a job
- 💞️ In the future, I want to collaborate on large projects and maybe even create something of my own.
