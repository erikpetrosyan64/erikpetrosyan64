- 👋 Hi, I'm Erik
- 👀 I am interested in desktop programs, automation, bots and more.
- 🌱 Now I am studying the C # programming language and can already consider myself a Junior developer, but so far I have no work experience in the company.
- 💞️ In the future, I want to collaborate on large projects and maybe even create something of my own.
